    "stages": {
        "Early": "Small white or light-colored patches start appearing on the skin, commonly on hands, face, feet, or around the eyes and mouth.",

        "Advanced": "Large areas of skin lose color and patches become more noticeable and widespread."

    "risk_factors": "Family history of vitiligo or autoimmune diseases, stress, skin injury, and other immune system disorders.",
    "preventive_measures": "There is no sure way to prevent vitiligo, but protecting the skin from sunburn, avoiding skin injuries, managing stress, and using sunscreen can help reduce damage.",
    "solution": "Treatment focuses on restoring skin color and stopping the spread. This includes topical creams, light therapy (phototherapy), skin grafting in severe cases, and cosmetic camouflage. A doctor should guide treatment.",
