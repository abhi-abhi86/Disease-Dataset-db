    ],
    "description": "A very common and destructive fungal disease of tomato plants, caused by *Septoria lycopersici*. It is characterized by numerous small, circular spots on the leaves, which leads to severe yellowing, browning, and defoliation, weakening the plant and reducing fruit yield.",
    "pathogen": {
        "type": "Fungal",
        "genus": "Septoria",
        "species": "Septoria lycopersici"

        "Tomato",
        "Potato",

    "symptoms": [
        "Small, circular, water-soaked spots on leaf undersides",
        "Spots with dark margins and gray/white centers",
        "Black dots (pycnidia) in the center of spots",
        "Yellowing of leaves around spots",
        "Defoliation starting from the bottom up",
        "Sunscald on exposed fruit"
    ],
    "disease_stages": {
        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Begins as small (1-3 mm), water-soaked, circular spots, primarily on the undersides of older, lower leaves. These spots are often numerous.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Small water-soaked undersurface spots",
                "Spots mainly on lower leaves"
            ]
        },
        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "The spots enlarge and become well-defined, developing a characteristic appearance: a dark brown or black border with a lighter tan or grayish-white center. Tiny black dots (pycnidia, the fungal fruiting bodies) can often be seen in the center of the spots. As the spots multiply, the leaves turn yellow, then brown, wither, and fall off (defoliation). This defoliation progresses rapidly from the bottom of the plant upwards, leaving stems bare and exposing fruit to sunscald.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Gray-center spots with dark borders",
                "Black dots in spots",
                "Significant yellowing"
            ]
        },
        "advanced_stage": {
            "description": "Almost complete defoliation. Fruit is small and sun-scalded due to lack of leaf cover. The plant is severely stunted.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Bare stems",
                "Sunscalded fruit",
                "Dead leaves on ground"
            ]
        }
    },
    "causes": "Caused by the fungus *Septoria lycopersici*. The fungus survives the winter on infected plant debris left in the field, on tomato stakes, and on some solanaceous weeds (like nightshade). Spores are spread by splashing water (rain, overhead irrigation) and wind-driven rain.",

        "Splashing rain",

        "environment": "Warm (20-25\u00b0C / 68-77\u00b0F), wet, and humid conditions. Long periods of high humidity and leaf wetness are essential for infection. Crowded planting and poor air circulation exacerbate the disease by keeping leaves wet for longer."

    "severity_level": "High (can cause 100% loss of foliage)",
    "impact": {
        "crop_loss_percentage": "Up to 100% defoliation; reduced fruit yield and quality",
        "economic_impact": "Loss of marketable fruit due to sunscald and reduced size. Cost of fungicide applications."

    "prevention": [
        "Use certified disease-free seeds and transplants.",
        "Practice crop rotation (a 3-4 year rotation away from tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant is ideal).",
        "**Remove and destroy all plant debris** at the end of the season.",
        "Mulch the soil heavily to create a barrier against spores splashing up onto the lower leaves.",
        "Water at the base of the plant (e.g., drip irrigation) to keep foliage dry.",
        "Stake or trellis plants and prune lower leaves to improve air circulation."

    "treatment": {
        "chemical_control": [
            "Remove and destroy infected leaves as soon as they are appear to reduce the spread. Apply protective fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based) preventatively or at the first sign of disease. It is crucial to start applications before the disease becomes severe and to reapply according to label instructions, especially after rain."
