    "description": "A very common and destructive fungal disease of tomato plants, caused by *Septoria lycopersici*. It is characterized by numerous small, circular spots on the leaves, which leads to severe yellowing, browning, and defoliation, weakening the plant and reducing fruit yield.",

        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Begins as small (1-3 mm), water-soaked, circular spots, primarily on the undersides of older, lower leaves. These spots are often numerous.",

        },
        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "The spots enlarge and become well-defined, developing a characteristic appearance: a dark brown or black border with a lighter tan or grayish-white center. Tiny black dots (pycnidia, the fungal fruiting bodies) can often be seen in the center of the spots. As the spots multiply, the leaves turn yellow, then brown, wither, and fall off (defoliation). This defoliation progresses rapidly from the bottom of the plant upwards, leaving stems bare and exposing fruit to sunscald.",

Mulch the soil heavily to create a barrier against spores splashing up onto the lower leaves. Water at the base of the plant (e.g., drip irrigation) to keep foliage dry. Stake or trellis plants and prune lower leaves to improve air circulation."
