        "environment": "Warm weather, moderate humidity, and injured plants increase the chance of infection. Damage caused by insects, hail, or mechanical work in the field makes it easier for the fungus to enter. Too much nitrogen fertilizer also increases the risk of disease. Drought stress followed by rain can also trigger it."
