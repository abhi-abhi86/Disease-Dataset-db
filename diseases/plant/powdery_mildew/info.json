    "description": "Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that affects a wide variety of plants. It is easily recognized by distinct white, powdery fungal growth on leaves and stems. Unlike many other fungal pathogens, powdery mildew can thrive in dry conditions with high humidity and does not require free water on the leaf surface to germinate.",

        "type": "Fungus",
        "genus": "Multiple (e.g., Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Blumeria)",

            "description": "Leaves curl, wither, and brown. Flower buds may fail to open or produce poor quality fruit. Severe infection can stunt plant growth.",
