  "common_names": [],
  "description": "A fungal disease affecting maize (corn), caused by Ustilago maydis. It produces large, swollen galls on ears, leaves, stems, and tassels, which later burst and release black, powdery spores, severely reducing crop quality and yield.",

  "symptoms": [],
  "disease_stages": {
    "early_stage": {
      "description": "Appears as small, light-colored swellings or bumps on young corn tissues such as leaves, stems, or ears. These swellings slowly increase in size over time.",
      "visual_signs": []
    },
    "middle_stage": {
      "description": "The swellings grow into large galls filled with black, powdery fungal spores. The outer covering of the gall breaks open and releases spores into the air, which spreads the disease to other plants.",

  "causes": "Caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis. The spores can survive in soil and plant waste for a long time. The fungus enters the plant through wounds caused by insects, farming tools, wind damage, or natural openings of the plant.",
  "mode_of_transmission": [],
  "favorable_conditions": {
    "temperature": "Unknown",
    "humidity": "Unknown",
    "environment": "Warm weather, moderate humidity, and injured plants increase the chance of infection. Damage caused by insects, hail, or mechanical work in the field makes it easier for the fungus to enter. Too much nitrogen fertilizer also increases the risk of disease."

  "prevention": [
    "Use disease",
    "resistant corn varieties whenever possible. Avoid injuring plants during farming activities such as weeding and ploughing. Control insect pests because they create wounds on the plant that help the fungus to enter. Remove and destroy infected plant parts and old crop waste after harvesting. Follow crop rotation and do not grow corn in the same field every year. Use balanced fertilizer and avoid using too much nitrogen. Keep the field clean and maintain good farm hygiene to reduce the number of fungal spores in the soil."

  "treatment": {
    "chemical_control": [
      "There is no direct chemical cure for Corn Smut once the plant is infected. The best control method is early detection and removal. Infected galls should be removed and destroyed before they burst and spread spores. Heavily infected plants should be uprooted and destroyed. The field should be cleaned after harvesting to remove all infected plant remains. In the next season, farmers should plant resistant varieties and follow crop rotation. Proper care of the crop, good nutrition management, and insect control help to reduce future infections and protect healthy plants."
