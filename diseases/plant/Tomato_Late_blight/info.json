        "Water-soaked, irregular green/brown spots on leaves",

    "disease_stages": {
        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Often begins as pale green or dark, water-soaked, irregular-shaped spots, typically near the edges or tips of leaves. In humid conditions, a fuzzy, white mold (sporangia) may appear on the underside of the leaf, especially in the early morning.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Water-soaked leaf edges",
                "Light green halos"

        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "The spots rapidly enlarge, turning dark brown to black and becoming necrotic (dead). The entire leaf can be destroyed quickly. The infection spreads to stems, causing large, dark lesions. On fruit, it appears as large, firm, oily-looking, brownish-grey lesions that can rot the entire fruit.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Large brown leaf lesions",
                "Stem cankers",

        "advanced_stage": {
            "description": "Rapid destruction of all foliage and fruit. The field may emit a foul odor of rotting vegetation. Tubers/fruit rot and secondary infections set in.",

                "Total plant collapse",

    "causes": "Caused by the water mold *Phytophthora infestans*. The pathogen survives in infected potato tubers (seed or 'volunteers') and infected plant debris. Its spores are easily spread long distances by wind and locally by splashing rain.",

        "humidity": "High humidity (>90%) is critical",
        "environment": "Cool, moist weather is ideal for late blight. High humidity (over 90%), frequent rain, fog, or heavy dew, combined with cool to moderate temperatures (typically 15-24\u00b0C or 60-75\u00b0F) create perfect conditions for infection and explosive spread."

        "crop_loss_percentage": "Up to 100% within days",

        "Destroy all 'volunteer' potato or tomato plants.",
        "Ensure good air circulation with proper spacing and pruning.",
        "Water at the base of the plant (e.g., drip irrigation) to keep foliage dry.",
        "Monitor weather forecasts for 'blight warnings' and apply preventative fungicides."

    "treatment": {
        "chemical_control": [
            "**Immediate action is critical.** Remove and destroy (burn or bag and dispose, do not compost) all infected plant material immediately. Apply fungicides as soon as symptoms are seen or when conditions are favorable. Fungicides (e.g., chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based products, or specific systemic fungicides like metalaxyl) are essential for control. Rotate fungicide types to prevent resistance."
