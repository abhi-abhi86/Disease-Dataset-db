    "description": "A common fungal disease of tomatoes, particularly in high-humidity environments like greenhouses, caused by *Passalora fulva*. It is characterized by yellow spots on the upper leaf surface and a velvety, olive-green mold on the corresponding underside.",

    "symptoms": [
        "Pale yellow/light green spots on upper leaf surface",

        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Begins as pale green or yellowish, indefinite spots on the upper surface of older, lower leaves. The corresponding underside of the leaf may show a slight, pale gray mold.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Pale yellow spots (upper side)",
                "Faint gray fuzz (underside)"

        },
        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "The yellow spots on the upper surface enlarge and become more distinct. On the leaf underside, a dense, velvety, olive-green to brownish fungal growth (spores) develops. Severely infected leaves turn yellow, then brown, wither, die, and may fall off (defoliation), progressing up the plant. The disease can also infect blossoms and fruit.",

            "description": "Widespread necrosis and defoliation. Yield is reduced due to loss of photosynthetic area. Infected flowersabort.",

    "causes": "Caused by the fungus *Passalora fulva* (formerly *Fulvia fulva* or *Cladosporium fulvum*). The fungus survives on infected plant debris in the soil and on greenhouse structures. Spores are easily spread by wind, splashing water, contaminated tools, and clothing.",

        "humidity": "High humidity (>85%) is critical",
        "environment": "**High relative humidity (above 85%)** is the most critical factor for infection. Poor air circulation due to crowded planting, lack of pruning, or enclosed greenhouse environments. Long periods of leaf wetness. Moderate temperatures (18-26\u00b0C / 65-79\u00b0F) favor its development."

    "treatment": {
        "chemical_control": [
            "Remove and destroy infected leaves as soon as they are spotted. Apply protective fungicides (e.g., copper-based, chlorothalonil, mancozeb), ensuring thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. Fungicides are most effective when applied preventatively or at the very first sign of disease, especially when high-humidity conditions are expected."
