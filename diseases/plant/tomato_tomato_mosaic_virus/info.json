    "description": "A highly infectious viral disease affecting tomato plants, along with other members of the nightshade family. It is characterized by mosaic patterns, mottling, and malformation of leaves, leading to stunted plants and reduced fruit yield and quality.",

    "symptoms": [
        "Light/dark green mosaic mottling on leaves",

        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Often appears on younger leaves as light green or yellowish mottling, or a 'mosaic' pattern of light and dark green areas. Vein clearing (where the veins appear lighter than the leaf tissue) can also be an early symptom.",
            "visual_signs": [
                "Mottled leaf color",

        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "Leaves become severely distorted, puckered, blistered, and stunted. Leaflets may become fern-like, narrow, or 'stringy'. The entire plant's growth is often stunted. Fruits may be small, malformed, ripen unevenly, or show internal browning (blotchy ripening).",

        "advanced_stage": {
            "description": "Plant is severely stunted and bushy. Fruit yield is negligible and quality is poor (blotchy/brown interior).",

    "causes": "Caused by the **Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV)**, a very stable plant pathogenic virus. It is easily transmitted mechanically through contaminated hands, clothing, and tools (pruners, stakes). It can also be spread through infected seed and can persist in dried plant debris or sap for years.",

        "temperature": "Can occur in wide range",

Using contaminated tools without sanitation. Tobacco users (smokers, chewers) handling plants, as the virus can be present in tobacco products and transferred via hands. Planting infected seeds or transplants."
