        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Begins as small (less than 3mm), dark, water-soaked, circular spots on the undersides of leaves. These spots may appear slightly raised and are often more visible when the leaf is held up to the light.",

            "description": "The leaf spots enlarge, the centers turn dark brown to black, and they are often surrounded by a distinct yellow halo. The centers may dry out and fall away, giving the leaf a 'shot-hole' appearance. On fruit, spots are initially small, raised, and scabby, eventually becoming warty and cracked. Severe infection leads to widespread leaf yellowing and leaf drop (defoliation).",

    "causes": "Caused by several species of bacteria in the genus *Xanthomonas* (e.g., *Xanthomonas campestris* pv. *vesicatoria*). The pathogen is easily spread by splashing water from rain or overhead irrigation, wind-driven rain, contaminated tools, and handling wet plants. It often enters the plant through natural openings (stomata).",

            "Remove and destroy infected leaves or plants as soon as symptoms appear to reduce the spread. Avoid working in the garden when plants are wet. Apply protective sprays containing fixed copper (e.g., copper hydroxide, copper sulfate) or a combination of copper and mancozeb.
