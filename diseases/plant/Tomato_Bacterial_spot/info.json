    "description": "A common and often destructive bacterial disease that affects tomato and pepper plants, causing lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit. It can lead to significant defoliation, reduced plant vigor, and unmarketable fruit.",

        "Small, dark, water-soaked spots on leaves",
        "Spots turn black with greasy margin",
        "Yellow halo around spots (sometimes)",

    "disease_stages": {
        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Begins as small (less than 3mm), dark, water-soaked, circular to irregular spots on leaves. These spots are often more apparent on the underside of the leaves and may have a greasy appearance.",

                "Greasy wet spots",
                "Dark specks"

        },
        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "The leaf spots enlarge, and the centers turn dark brown to black, often surrounded by a distinct yellow halo. The centers may dry out and tear, giving the leaf a 'shot-hole' appearance. Severe infection leads to widespread leaf yellowing (chlorosis) and significant leaf drop (defoliation), starting from the bottom of the plant. On fruit, spots are initially small, dark, and slightly raised, later becoming larger, scabby, and cracked, providing entry points for secondary rots.",

    "causes": "Caused by several species of bacteria in the genus *Xanthomonas* (e.g., *Xanthomonas perforans*, *Xanthomonas euvesicatoria*). The pathogen is easily spread by splashing water (rain, overhead irrigation), wind-driven rain, contaminated tools, and handling wet plants. It often enters the plant through natural openings like stomata and hydathodes.",

Apply protective sprays containing fixed copper (e.g., copper hydroxide) or a combination of copper and mancozeb.
