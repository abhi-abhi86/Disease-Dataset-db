    "description": "A highly destructive viral disease affecting tomato plants, transmitted by the silverleaf whitefly. It is characterized by severe stunting of the plant, and upward curling and yellowing of the leaves, leading to significant or total loss of fruit yield.",

    "symptoms": [
        "Upward curling of leaf margins (cupping)",
        "Yellowing (chlorosis) of leaf margins",
        "Small, crumpled leaves",
        "Severe stunting of the plant",

    "disease_stages": {
        "early_stage": {
            "description": "Often appears on new growth. Young leaves show slight yellowing (chlorosis), especially on the margins, and begin to curl upwards. The plant's growth rate may start to slow down.",

                "Leaves yellowing at edges",
                "Leaf cupping"
            ]
        },
        "middle_stage": {
            "description": "Leaves become severely stunted, thickened, leathery, and cup strongly upwards. Leaf margins are bright yellow, often with green remaining along the veins. The entire plant becomes severely dwarfed or stunted, with shortened internodes giving it a 'bushy' appearance. Flower production is drastically reduced, and any fruit that sets is small, malformed, and unmarketable. Infection at an early stage often results in total yield loss.",

        "advanced_stage": {
            "description": "Total growth arrest. No fruit set. Existing fruit remains small and falls off. The plant functions as a virus reservoir.",

                "Bonsai-like plant appearance",
