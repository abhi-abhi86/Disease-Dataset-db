    "description": "A common and highly destructive plant pest, not an insect but an arachnid (mite). These tiny pests feed by piercing plant cells and sucking out their contents, causing a characteristic stippling on leaves, which can lead to severe plant stress, defoliation, and reduced yield.",

        "advanced_stage": {
            "description": "Heavy webbing covers the plant ('tents'). Leaves turn brown and crisp, then fall off. Plant vitality is severely compromised, potentially leading to death.",

        "humidity": "Low / Dry (< 50% RH)",
        "environment": "**Hot, dry, and dusty conditions** are ideal for spider mite outbreaks. Low humidity, drought-stressed plants, and the overuse of broad-spectrum insecticides (which kill off their natural predators like ladybugs and predatory mites) strongly favor their rapid multiplication."

    },
    "prevention": [
        "Maintain adequate plant hydration; spider mites thrive on stressed plants.",
        "Regularly spray plants with water, focusing on the undersides of leaves, to increase humidity and dislodge mites.",
        "Encourage natural predators.",

        "chemical_control": [
            "For mild infestations, a strong blast of water can be effective. Apply insecticidal soap or horticultural oil (like neem oil), ensuring **thorough coverage** of the entire plant, especially the undersides of leaves. Repeat applications every 5-7 days to control newly hatched mites. For severe cases, releasing predatory mites (*Phytoseiulus persimilis*) is an effective biological control, or specific chemical miticides can be used (rotate products to prevent resistance)."
